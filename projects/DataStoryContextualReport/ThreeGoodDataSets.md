[Qanon Posts](https://github.com/jkingsman/JSON-QAnon)

This is a collection of posts by Qanon supporters up until January 25, 2021. I think this is a good dataset to create a project around because of the multitude of conspiracy theories that come from these posts. I also wanted to look into a dataset about Qanon because my aunt has been sucked into it. She believes fully in the cabal and that Trump is the only one to save us from it, along with continuing to believe that there was election fraud.  

[Capitol Riot Tweets](https://github.com/cwhaley112/capitol-riot-tweets)

These are all of the tweets made on the day of the Capitol Riots on January 6, 2021. I think this is an interesting dataset to look into because there were claims that there was no way for the police to know that there would be such a large riot, but I believe these tweets to say otherwise. I would like to analyze the tweets over a 18 hour period of 6am to midnight EST on January 6. I selected these specifically because it can show the pre-cursor, during, and after, including when people began identifying rioters on social media to be caught by the FBI.

[Jeopardy Clue Archive](https://github.com/jvani/jarchive-clues)

This is a dataset of all of the Jeopardy clues over the years. I think this would be a fun dataset to work with because they have never used a Jeopardy clue twice, so it will be a very diverse set with different themes. I also would like to look into where clues have the same answer, because while Jeopardy does have different clues, how many different answers do they actually have?
