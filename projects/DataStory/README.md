## The Project
 - Jeopardy! : The Strategy

 - This project is based on the American trivia game show Jeopardy! I wanted to find out a strategy to winning the game show besides just knowing all the answers to the questions.

  - Using python, I scraped data about contestants, questions, categories, and placement of Daily Doubles

## The Process

- Why did you choose to visualize the data in this way?
- I chose to visualize data like this in order to mimic the way the normal Jeopardy! board looks. This may not seem so obvious to anyone who has not seen the show, but I tried to create a better understanding with the Intro Jeopardy! so people could read through and see what the game was all about.
- What can be seen in the visualization? Does it reveal something you didn't expect?
- In this visualization, you can see the likelihood of finding a Daily Double in each round and how the placement has changed over the seasons in each round. I thought the Daily Doubles would be randomly placed all over the board so that were would be an equal chance of getting one from any clue, however they tended to show up in the fourth row, the most often.
- Did you make crucial compromises? Which ones?
- A compromise I had to make was choosing to cut out the Final Jeopardy round because the data I had was incomplete for what I wanted to do, and instead of just working with what I had, I cut it completely.
- If you had more time, what would you change, improve, add to the project?
- If I had more time, I would have devoted more energy into creating a better user interface and adding in the interactivity of a Final Jeopardy round in which users could see how likely they were to be on Jeopardy.
