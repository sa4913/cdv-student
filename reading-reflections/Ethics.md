Right to be Forgotten Notes

The digital footprint that doesn't end
No question of whether or not they should
To what degree that people get the right to be forgotten if they committed a crime and how far does it go
If a lawyer public defender can have his name erased why isn't a police officer in the same way?
Police officers find job at other stations all the time, they don't check, we've seen this most recently over the past year
I think it's good that they keep the spreadsheet because in the case in the future they can provide the information
How do you decide when to release from the vault?
How do you determine what can be taken down off of the internet (EU relation)?
If you're enabling people to do drugs, that's not something innocent
Of course, if it's mostly white and mostly men and mostly college-educated is going to create a bias
I think it's good that they put the note that they have been asked to remove the name and has been passed through the process
I feel very little sympathy for this guy
I do feel bad for his family, because they didn't deserve this
I also think the women will face trauma for seeing their experience erased


The End of Privacy as We Know it? Notes

Using facial recognition tools would make it radical if taking without permission
facial recognition technology is a nightmare because it's extremely bad at recognizing faces exactly, my Google Photos tries to differentiate my friends from each other and has a problem with it if you're not white differentiating faces, going to be another tough thing to justify because "if the technology says so, it doesn't have feelings"
Ironic that the tool that they have created is trying to hide its own location out of the public sphere
This story sounds like an online scam with the Nigerian prince
Law enforcement already using the app but not informing the public
The US police trying to act as good guys when they use this kind of technology is funny
That's actually so crazy that they have journalists flagged, like that's not suspicious
What if it's a "private" account?
Black mirror-like
What if the public is to use it back on the police?
They don't have that power

Supreme Court of Facebook Notes

How do you moderate every single post?
It's not a liberal plot if he violated the terms and policies like a any normal user
Oversight Board sounds like Big Brother (Supreme Court of Facebook)
How to develop trust among company moderators
created oversight that was separate from Facebook in order to also drag attention about moderation of Facebook away from Facebook
Use control to create different forms of government that will not make terrible decisions
How does this court not become corrupt?
talking sessions = focus groups?
If no one is paying attention about this global board how does it prevent Facebook from choosing people they want?
What determines the difference between socially acceptable humor and what is not? How do you judge that in different social settings (regions, countries, governments, etc.)?
Aromo is also a majority, so does that count as punching up?
Jawar is sitting in Minnesota, seems a little odd for him to be leading this protest in Ethiopia
Facebook used to turn the positive change to go further and get toxic
Does this mean that the Aromo people would like a retaliation to make other ethnic groups marginalized?
yup
So, someone was exiled but is afraid of xenophobia in his own country? a little hypocritical
I think you're not only seeing this kind of thing happening in Ethiopia but also in the US with the capitol riots and without consequences
I think Facebook made me realize that I'm more liberal than I thought because of all the family members I have added's freedom of expression of thinking about free healthcare as something only found to be helpful by socialists.
I think it has to be an indefinite ban because Facebook said they had trouble trying to ban him before because he was a US president. In addition, if a user breaks the rules, they also get banned. It's not like world leaders don't have a national platform to use
Online Court Systems?
It's not anti-conservative bias but making sure that there's no hate speech? and making sure that people get the correct information
@ Marjorie Taylor Greene
Need to look up that Mel Brooks work about the space laser
