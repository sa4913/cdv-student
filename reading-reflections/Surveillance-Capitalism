In your own words, what does Zuboff mean by "Surveillance Capitalism".
Is there aspects of Zuboff's ideas that...

Response to Surveillance capitalism
Zuboff clearly defines the difference between just normal capitalism and surveillance capitalism. Capitalism involves taking the data of consumers with constant consent such as through feedback surveys, or manual input. However, surveillance capitalism is the taking of the consumer data without the concern of consent each time. Companies who abuse this power claim convenience and offer terms of service in small print and are too lengthy for the consumer to actually know where their data is going. Surveillance capitalism is also based on the abuse of this data to influence decisions. For example, QAnon has been using the data it has scraped from Facebook to target those who are more likely to be susceptible to their message. This abuse of data has caused mass delusion and a base for Donald Trump to have the elections become a "fraud" and the media to become distrusted.
In terms of sparking associations, Zuboff's idea of surveillance capitalism sounds exactly like a Black Mirror episode. There's a few episodes where they create a metaphor about surveillance capitalism. I didn't think about it at the time, but it immediately hit me while reading. There's one episode in which they clone your brain in order to create a "smart home" that will have your behaviors memorized because it's you stuck in a smaller device, a metaphor for the trapping effect of the surveillance capitalism that we are dealing with currently. In a separate episode, the abuse of data is used to force a man to admit to a crime he committed by placing him in a digital landscape with himself and another guy to develop a relationship and then admit to what he did by telling the story. I consider this another form of surveillance capitalism as defined by Zuboff because it's a direct abuse of data in order to influence human behavior. 
I think an immediate question that comes to mind is how to avoid the complete takeover of surveillance capitalism as there seems to be no place where companies are not scraping data for the point of exploiting data to sell to other companies. I am concerned with this question because laws currently are not keeping up with this new type of abuse as specifically the US thrives on the free market economy and the idea of individualism, so would governments stepping in to stop this behavior come at a time too late for the damage to already be done? If the government is also willing to exploit this data as well as a way to expand their own surveillance, what protects the people from being used as a cog in the system while trying to be a member of the digital age?

Notes on Surveillance Capitalism
I think it's hard to make the digital future our home as much of the comfort people understand comes from a physical space or experience.
I agree about the exponential rise of technology being an issue as laws cannot keep up with it.
I think one advantage to this dilemma of knowledge, authority, and power not being confined to the workplace has been helpful for sexual harassment/assault survivors because they're able to corroborate stories with more confidence. However, the negative side has also forced people to be able to work all hours because they have the affordability of technology at home, similar to that at work.
"We still recount the travails of Odysseus and recall what human beings will endure for the sake of reaching our own shores and entering our own gates" <-- I think that's an interesting analysis of Odysseus, I didn't really think about that bigger picture when I read it.
This defining of home is completely why I was mad to be required to be sent "home" by admin in late January.
This project sounds like a Black Mirror episode
I get that they were trying to keep the information private, but the information can be hacked if stored digitally, putting the user at risk.
The Nest merger to Google was the reason my dad switched our thermostat to a EcoBee, too much data collection with the Nest.
I think it's interesting to read about the shifting of behavior through the use of surveillance capitalism because I feel that this is more visible during elections.
I think surveillance capitalism often works in favor of the government as it's able to shape public opinion without the knowledge of the public, often subverting the main view.
The "if you have nothing to hide" excuse has been used for years by police and they continue to injure and murder innocent people, with a lack of transparency, surveillance capitalism feels the same.
So is her issue with surveillance capitalism in general or the greediness of capitalism?
DuckDuckGo as an alternative to the incessant tracking of Google?
Where there's an economic action there's technology
There is no "rational capitalism". Money is the goal with a lack of empathy for those who get lost along the way.
As predicted, government just reap in the benefits of surveillance capitalism
Capitalism claims itself to be a free market, but if there is no free will with the use of surveillance capitalism, is it really a free market?
Capitalism involves constant consent while surveillance capitalism is the unknowing scraping of data with only a single permission to begin
