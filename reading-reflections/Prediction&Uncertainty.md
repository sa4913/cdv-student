Notes on Statistics
well-respected man more like well-respected murderer
His background as a doctor does make him a more reliable person to just have a stroke of bad luck over a thirty-five year career, especially with older patients
Seems like that prison was not a large enough deterrent in 1830s France to not commit crimes, considering the July Revolution and other similar acts against the government were happening
I think general statistics are able to have accuracy but predictive crime before someone is going to commit it leads to discrimination and an inability to prove that someone is innocent of their crime as there's no evidence that they even did it besides the prediction
That is actually so crazy that she became the oldest person on record when they agreed to that deal
In the case of the statin pill then people in the US should also wear masks to understand that it's a minor inconvenience that helps a majority
statistical significance - enough out of the ordinary to not be by chance (flipping coin example) (no more than 5 percent, one in 20)
With enough data statistically unlikely outcomes can be made
I also think about the shuffle being a pattern because I almost always hear close to the exact same order on my Spotify playlists
How to fix if the flukes are gaining a lot of attention?
Trying to understand human expressions with a dead animal *definitely* makes conclusive sense
With enough studies, a threshold can be met, no issue and therein lies the problem with setting a threshold
Does the suspicion then lead to investigation into the background of the doctor? Would this happen for other professions or studies as well?


Notes on Minority Report
"in a sense they are innocent"
what determines which cards will be discarded?
does extortion really only count as a petty crime?
"Use your own judgement"  places a lot of burden to determine who actually will be taken in for the rest of their lives
Corruption card pop up as well for hiding his own card?
self-fulfilling prophecy to come?
wouldn't the kidnapping also come up in the cards? or is that too "high-profile" for it to matter?
Why kidnap him if they're going to turn him into the police? to make sure he didn't escape?
what if the whole system was broken, hmm? a system broken with all of the cards stacked against you because you're just part of a statistic
secret police?
The existence of a majority logically implies A corresponding majority. Feel like there should be a corresponding minority
best 2 out of three system, very playground
if the minority report says he's innocent would he be able to make a case for innocence?
a unique case, probably not
wife prioritizing the trust in the police over the trust in the people is tough
First day assumption to the police commissioner job was probably not the best practice in getting better at being a  police officer. Probably should be suspicious if you're first day you were promoted
create military law to prevent the military from rising up, interesting strategy
self-fulfilling prophecy, knew it
no suspicion is the real crime of this story
The privilege of having access to the precogs is what is able to save him, he doesn't even question if this could happen again
